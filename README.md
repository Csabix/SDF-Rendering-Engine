# SDF Rendering Engine
## Interactive Rendering Engine for surfaces defined by Singed Distance Functions

The rendering engine visualised surfaces based on signed distance function (SDF). The engine is was written in C++ and OpenGL from scratch. The code running on the GPU can be generated and compiled on-the-fly. Examples scenes include CSG models, meta-surfaces, and the Mandelbulb fractal.
